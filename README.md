# Archroid
Android architecture library that generates boilerplate codes through annotation processing.
This project is mostly inspired by [SVC](https://github.com/BansookNam/svc) github library project, which provides different pattern called SVC (Screen, View, ControlTower). Those who are interested in the pattern, please visit the repository.
- This library will produce boilerplate codes through annotation processing when building architecture from android app.
- This library is aimed at providing an easy environment that is convenient to manage or refactor business logic by replacing repetitive codes with annotation.
